### Project Description
CountAnything AI is an advanced object counting system that uses multiple computer vision algorithms, AI models, and stunning UI themes to count any object in real-time or from uploaded images. From rice grains to coins, hair strands to general objects - if it exists, we can count it with ridiculous precision and beautiful visualizations.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever found yourself staring at a pile of rice and thinking, "Gosh, I wish I could count these 10,000 grains individually but with STYLE"? Or perhaps you've been losing sleep over the exact number of coins in your collection while wishing for neon particle effects? Maybe you needed to count hair strands with cyberpunk-themed overlays? We've all been there.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created an over-engineered, AI-powered, multi-algorithm, theme-switching, real-time counting machine that can detect and count objects with the precision of a Swiss watch and the visual flair of a rave party. Complete with 4 stunning UI themes, ensemble detection methods, and enough features to make a NASA engineer jealous.
