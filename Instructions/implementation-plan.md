# Implementation Plan
1. **Set Up Project Environment**: Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt. Set up the file structure using Cursor AI. **Done.**
   - Created project directory structure (app/, data/, app/models/, app/utils/, app/database/, data/images/)
   - Created requirements.txt with compatible dependencies
   - Successfully installed all dependencies (streamlit, opencv-python, ultralytics, pillow, numpy)
   - Created initial main.py file with Streamlit app structure
2. **Implement Image Processing**: Use Cursor AI to generate code for OpenCV and YOLOv8 in `image_processor.py` to preprocess and count objects in images. **Done.**
   - Created comprehensive ImageProcessor class with OpenCV and YOLOv8 integration
   - Implemented image preprocessing with enhancement techniques (Gaussian blur, CLAHE)
   - Added YOLOv8 object detection with confidence scoring and bounding box visualization
   - Created fallback blob detection method for when YOLOv8 is unavailable
   - Built specialized CountModel class for different object types (rice, coins, hair)
   - Added contextual insights generation based on count results
3. **Build Streamlit Interface**: Create a Streamlit app in `main.py` with image upload, result display, and history view, using Cursor AI for quick UI generation. **Done.**
   - Enhanced Streamlit interface with modern UI design and custom CSS styling
   - Added object type selection (rice, coins, hair, general) in sidebar
   - Implemented confidence threshold adjustment slider
   - Created dual-column layout for original and processed images
   - Added progress bar and loading animations for better UX
   - Built comprehensive history page with statistics and metrics
   - Added About page with project information and features
   - Implemented contextual insights and success/error messaging
4. **Set Up Database**: Implement SQLite in `db.py` to store count history and image metadata, with Cursor AI assistance for schema creation. **Done.**
   - Created comprehensive DatabaseManager class with SQLite integration
   - Implemented three database tables: count_history, image_metadata, user_settings
   - Added methods for saving count results, image metadata, and user preferences
   - Built history retrieval with sorting and limiting capabilities
   - Created statistics generation for dashboard analytics
   - Added database information and maintenance functions
   - Implemented user settings management for preferences
5. **Test and Polish**: Test the app with diverse images (e.g., rice, hair, coins) to ensure accuracy. Add visual overlays and loading animations in Streamlit for demo appeal. **Done.**
   - Created comprehensive test script (test_app.py) to verify all components
   - Successfully tested all imports and module functionality
   - Verified YOLOv8 model loading and image processing capabilities
   - Confirmed database operations and history tracking
   - Created detailed README.md with installation and usage instructions
   - Added troubleshooting guide and performance tips
   - Implemented comprehensive documentation for hackathon demo
   - All core features tested and working: YOLOv8 detection, OpenCV processing, SQLite database, Streamlit UI
