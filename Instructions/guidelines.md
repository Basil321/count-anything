# Development Guidelines
1. **Keep Code Simple**: Write modular Python functions for image processing, model integration, and database operations to ensure clarity.
2. **Leverage Cursor AI**: Use Cursor AI to generate Streamlit UI code, YOLOv8 integration, and debug OpenCV errors.
3. **Test with Small Datasets**: Validate counting accuracy with a few images (e.g., 5-10 photos of rice or hair) before scaling.
4. **Optimize for Demo**: Focus on a clean Streamlit interface with visual feedback (e.g., image overlays, loading messages) to impress judges.
5. **Handle Image Variability**: Use OpenCV to preprocess images for different lighting or object overlap scenarios.
6. **Document Continuously**: Update the Instructions folder with any changes to maintain clarity for team members or judges.
