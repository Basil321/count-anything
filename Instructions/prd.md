# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
CountAnything AI is a Python-based application that enables users to upload or capture a photo and automatically count objects within it, such as rice grains, hair strands, or coins, using computer vision. The app provides accurate counts and contextual insights (e.g., estimating rice for cooking servings or hair density for health analysis). Designed for a hackathon, it aims to deliver a versatile, AI-driven tool for simplifying counting tasks in domains like cooking, healthcare, and inventory management, with a focus on a polished demo.

## Target Audience
- **General Users**: Individuals needing quick counts for everyday tasks (e.g., cooks estimating ingredients, hobbyists counting collectibles).
- **Professionals**: Small business owners for inventory (e.g., counting stock), educators for classroom activities, or health professionals for basic diagnostics (e.g., hair loss analysis).
- **Hackathon Judges**: Tech enthusiasts seeking innovative AI solutions with practical applications and engaging demos.

## Features
1. **Image Upload**: Users can upload a photo via a web interface for object counting.
2. **Object Counting**: AI-powered counting of objects (e.g., rice, hair, coins) using computer vision.
3. **Contextual Insights**: Provide additional information based on the count (e.g., “500 rice grains = ~2 servings” or “low hair density, consider health check”).
4. **Result Visualization**: Display counts with visual overlays (e.g., highlighting counted objects) on the image.
5. **History Tracking**: Save past counts with images for user reference in a local database.
6. **Simple Web Interface**: A clean, intuitive UI built with Streamlit for easy interaction and demo appeal.

## User Stories
1. **As a home cook**, I want to upload a photo of rice grains so I can estimate how many servings I can make for dinner.
2. **As a small business owner**, I want to upload a photo of coins to quickly count the total for inventory purposes.
3. **As a health-conscious user**, I want to upload a scalp photo to count hair strands and assess hair density for health insights.
